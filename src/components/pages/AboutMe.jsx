        <p className="fade-in">My journey into web development began with a fascination 
          for how design and technology combine to create meaningful user interactions. While I 
          enjoy exploring all aspects of development, Iâ€™m especially enthusiastic about web design 
          and front-end development, where I can unleash my creativity and enhance user experiences 
          through responsive, intuitive designs.</p>
